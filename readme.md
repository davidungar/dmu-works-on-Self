Experimental 64 Bit Version
===========================

This is an experimental branch of the Self VM.

It is a port of the Self VM to 64 bit systems.

It is downstream from the main Self repo at https://github.com/russellallen/self

At the moment the interpreter is working, but the JIT has not been ported.

You can build the VM by:

```
cmake -S vm64 -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)   
```

It should build on MacOS (arm64) and Linux (amd64 and arm64).

To generate an Xcode project, use `vm64/cmake-xcode.sh` (or
`vm64/cmake-xcode-visionos.sh` for visionOS) rather than `cmake -G Xcode`
directly: the wrappers run `fix-xcode-paths.py` afterwards so Xcode's atomic
saves don't clobber the `vm64/src` → `vm/src` symlink mirror.


AI Disclosure Statement
=======================

This port is LLM asssisted, using primarily Claude Anthropic.
